Hey <%= @receiver.name %>!

We've turned off Slack notifications for Kudos because we couldn't find
a Factual Slack account with the email <%= @receiver.email %>!

If you'd like to keep Slack notifications going, please double-check that the
email on your Slack account matches <%= @receiver.email %> and turn your Slack
notifications back on at: <%= @kudos_settings_url %>

If your Slack account exists but you keep seeing this message,
please open a ticket at: <%= @github_repo_url %>

Thanks,
Kudos Team
